# Microbit

This is a Microbit emulator that can be used as a module on any python program.

# Tests
We included a few python programs to test out this microbit emulator
## 1. [Connect 4](Tests/connect4.py)
- This game tests the display and buttons of the microbit.
- Press **button B** to move the player piece to the right (it wraps around the screen), and press **button A** to place down the piece.
- ***TODO:*** Fix vertical and diagonal wins (they don't work)
