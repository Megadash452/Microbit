# Microbit Projects
This repo contains projects we did with the Microbit in Team Edge Start.

## Slowly but surely, we'll add more games onto this repository
## 1. [Connect 4](Tests/connect4.py) made by Martin and Mahdi
- This game tests the display and buttons of the microbit.
- Press **button B** to move the player piece to the right (it wraps around the screen), and press **button A** to place down the piece.
- Player 1 and Player 2 are differentiated by the LED brightness level.
